					on March 19, 1891. He was appointed Cheif Justice by President Dwight Eisenhower in return for the help that Earl Warren 
					had given to President Eisenhower in winning the election. He was appointed for the office on October 2, 1953, and was
					elected on January 3, 1954. He was involved politically before the oppertunity for Chief Justice presented itself. 
					Some of the roles he played in society included deputy city attorney, deputy assistant district attorney, chief deputy 
					district attorney, district attorney, and attorney genral of California. Afterwards, he became the governor of California
					for 10 years. Then he was appointed for the Chief Justice and served for 15 years in this prestigious role. Earl Warren
					retired from this position in 1969, on June 3. He died in Washington D.C. on July 9, 1974. He served in the political 
					process for most of his life as an adult. He was responsible for many changes to the way the country runs. Even though
					he never became president, despite his attempts to become so as a Republican, he managed to impact history in a great
					way.
