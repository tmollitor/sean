					<p class="paragraph"><span style="margin-left:40px;">Chief Justice Earl Warren</span> achieved many things over his long
					political career. One of his main accomplishments occured at the begining of his career as Chief Justice. He 
					brought down the segregation of schools across the country through his direct influence of the Supreme Court. He created
					the unanimous decision that occured out of that case, Brown v. Board of Education. He did this because he believed 
					that all people deserved the same education. He also fought for the rights of the accused, and freedom of expression. 
					These goals were achieved through multiple cases. The rights of the accused were increased through the cases
					Mapp v. Ohio, Gideon v. Wainright, Griffin v. California, Miranda v. Arizona. These cases each did different things 
					to the rights of the accused. He helped freedom of expression the most in the case New York Times Co. v. Sullivan. 
					The intention of the court in this case was to allow the flow of information about government officials, because
					that is an essential part of the democratic process. Earl Warren achieved multiple goals and helped the way
					America runs in multiple different ways.</p>
